	abstract = {Learning to store information over extended time intervals by recurrent backpropagation takes a very long time, mostly because of insufficient, decaying error backflow. We briefly review Hochreiter's (1991) analysis of this problem, then address it by introducing a novel, efficient, gradient based method called long short-term memory ({LSTM}). Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, {LSTM} can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. {LSTM} is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O. 1. Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, {LSTM} leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster. {LSTM} also solves complex, artificial long-time-lag tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network algorithms.},

            Flash droughts pose large threats to crop yields and ecosystem services due to their sudden onset and rapid intensification, arousing wide public concern in a warming climate. Their long-term characteristics of change, underlying mechanisms, and especially potential impacts on agriculture, forests, and populations at a global scale, however, remain largely unknown. We used in situ observations, two observation-based global reanalysis data sets, and 22 Earth system models to determine that flash droughts are shifting toward more frequent, accelerated-onset, and longer duration. These changes increased the exposure of agricultural areas, forested areas, and populations to flash droughts by 20.3\%, 17.1\%, and 30.0\%, respectively, during 2001–2020 compared to 1981–2000, with a disproportionate increase in integrated risks across the Amazon Basin and eastern and southern Asia. The increase in concurrent hot and dry climatic conditions driven by warming has been mostly responsible for enabling and intensifying flash droughts over large regions. State-of-the-art Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 ({CMIP}6) models, however, failed to identify the acceleration of the onset time of flash droughts and widely underestimated the occurrence of flash droughts that are driven only by precipitation deficits or by heat waves, probably because they misrepresent the dependence between precipitation and temperature and underestimate the sensitivity of soil moisture to temperature and precipitation at short timescales (e.g., 5 days). These syntheses comprehensively advance our understanding of the characteristics and impacts of flash droughts but also highlight that the {CMIP}6 models need to be validated to represent the correct covariability between climatic variables at short timescales to provide more reliable projections of flash droughts.},

            Ocean acidification represents a threat to marine species worldwide, and forecasting the ecological impacts of acidification is a high priority for science, management, and policy. As research on the topic expands at an exponential rate, a comprehensive understanding of the variability in organisms' responses and corresponding levels of certainty is necessary to forecast the ecological effects. Here, we perform the most comprehensive meta‐analysis to date by synthesizing the results of 228 studies examining biological responses to ocean acidification. The results reveal decreased survival, calcification, growth, development and abundance in response to acidification when the broad range of marine organisms is pooled together. However, the magnitude of these responses varies among taxonomic groups, suggesting there is some predictable trait‐based variation in sensitivity, despite the investigation of approximately 100 new species in recent research. The results also reveal an enhanced sensitivity of mollusk larvae, but suggest that an enhanced sensitivity of early life history stages is not universal across all taxonomic groups. In addition, the variability in species' responses is enhanced when they are exposed to acidification in multi‐species assemblages, suggesting that it is important to consider indirect effects and exercise caution when forecasting abundance patterns from single‐species laboratory experiments. Furthermore, the results suggest that other factors, such as nutritional status or source population, could cause substantial variation in organisms' responses. Last, the results highlight a trend towards enhanced sensitivity to acidification when taxa are concurrently exposed to elevated seawater temperature.},

              Wentz et al.

              Meanwhile, general circulation models ({GCMs}) used to predict climate change simulate twentieth‐ and 21st‐century mean precipitation increases of about 13\% per °C [Held and Soden, 2006]. This difference seems surprising because some {GCMs} can adequately reproduce the much longer twentieth‐ century surface‐based land‐mean precipitation record [
              Lambert et al.

	abstract = {Mineral malnutrition stemming from undiversified plant-based diets is a top global challenge. In C3 plants (e.g., rice, wheat), elevated concentrations of atmospheric carbon dioxide ({eCO}2) reduce protein and nitrogen concentrations, and can increase the total non-structural carbohydrates ({TNC}; mainly starch, sugars). However, contradictory findings have obscured the effect of {eCO}2 on the ionome—the mineral and trace-element composition—of plants. Consequently, {CO}2-induced shifts in plant quality have been ignored in the estimation of the impact of global change on humans. This study shows that {eCO}2 reduces the overall mineral concentrations (−8\%, 95\% confidence interval: −9.1 to −6.9, p{\textless}0.00001) and increases {TNC}:minerals {\textgreater} carbon:minerals in C3 plants. The meta-analysis of 7761 observations, including 2264 observations at state of the art {FACE} centers, covers 130 species/cultivars. The attained statistical power reveals that the shift is systemic and global. Its potential to exacerbate the prevalence of ‘hidden hunger’ and obesity is discussed.
          , 
            Rice and wheat provide two out every five calories that humans consume. Like other plants, crop plants convert carbon dioxide (or {CO}2) from the air into sugars and other carbohydrates. They also take up minerals and other nutrients from the soil.
            The increase in {CO}2 in the atmosphere that has happened since the Industrial Revolution is thought to have increased the production of sugars and other carbohydrates in plants by up to 46\%. {CO}2 levels are expected to rise even further in the coming decades; and higher levels of {CO}2 are known to lead to lower levels of proteins in plants. But less is known about the effects of {CO}2 levels on the concentrations of minerals and other nutrients in plants.
            Loladze has investigated the effect of rising {CO}2 levels on the nutrient levels in food plants by analyzing data on 130 varieties of plants: his dataset includes the results of 7761 observations made over the last 30 years, by researchers around the world. Elevated {CO}2 levels were found to reduce the overall concentration of 25 important minerals—including calcium, potassium, zinc, and iron—in plants by 8\% on average. Furthermore, Loladze found that an increased exposure to {CO}2 also increased the ratio of carbohydrates to minerals in these plants.
            This reduction in the nutritional value of plants could have profound impacts on human health: a diet that is deficient in minerals and other nutrients can cause malnutrition, even if a person consumes enough calories. This type of malnutrition is common around the world because many people eat only a limited number of staple crops, and do not eat enough foods that are rich in minerals, such as fruits, vegetables, dairy and meats. Diets that are poor in minerals (in particular, zinc and iron) lead to reduced growth in childhood, to a reduced ability to fight off infections, and to higher rates of maternal and child deaths.
            Loladze argues that these changes might contribute to the rise in obesity, as people eat increasingly starchy plant-based foods, and eat more to compensate for the lower mineral levels found in crops. Looking to the future, these findings highlight the importance of breeding food crops to be more nutritious as the world's {CO}2 levels continue to rise.},

In this work, an ensemble of {EURO}-{CORDEX} {RCP}8.5 scenarios is used to drive a distributed hydrological model and assess the projected changes in flood hazard in Europe through the current century. Changes in magnitude and frequency of extreme streamflow events are investigated by statistical distribution fitting and peak over threshold analysis. A consistent method is proposed to evaluate the agreement of ensemble projections. Results indicate that the change in frequency of discharge extremes is likely to have a larger impact on the overall flood hazard as compared to the change in their magnitude.

              . Due to the complexity of runoff generation and the streamflow process, the historical impact of human-induced climate change on river flooding remains uncertain. Here, we address the question of whether anthropogenic climate change has altered the probability of the extreme river flood events for the period 1951–2010 based on simulated river discharge derived from large ensemble climate experiments with and without human-induced climate change. The results indicate that human-induced climate change altered the probabilities of 20 of the 52 analyzed flood events. Fourteen of these 20 flood events, which occurred mainly in Asia and South America, were very likely to have been enhanced by human-induced climate change due to an increase in heavy precipitation. Conversely, two flood events in North/South America and two flood events in Asia and two flood events in Europe were suppressed by human-induced climate change, perhaps as a result of lower snowfall. Human-induced climate change has enhanced flooding more prominently in recent years, providing important insights into potential adaptation strategies for river flooding.},

              This article reviews recent literature on drought of the last millennium, followed by an update on global aridity changes from 1950 to 2008. Projected future aridity is presented based on recent studies and our analysis of model simulations. Dry periods lasting for years to decades have occurred many times during the last millennium over, for example, North America, West Africa, and East Asia. These droughts were likely triggered by anomalous tropical sea surface temperatures ({SSTs}), with La Niña‐like {SST} anomalies leading to drought in North America, and El‐Niño‐like {SSTs} causing drought in East China. Over Africa, the southward shift of the warmest {SSTs} in the Atlantic and warming in the Indian Ocean are responsible for the recent Sahel droughts. Local feedbacks may enhance and prolong drought. Global aridity has increased substantially since the 1970s due to recent drying over Africa, southern Europe, East and South Asia, and eastern Australia. Although El Niño‐Southern Oscillation ({ENSO}), tropical Atlantic {SSTs}, and Asian monsoons have played a large role in the recent drying, recent warming has increased atmospheric moisture demand and likely altered atmospheric circulation patterns, both contributing to the drying. Climate models project increased aridity in the 21
              st
              century over most of Africa, southern Europe and the Middle East, most of the Americas, Australia, and Southeast Asia. Regions like the United States have avoided prolonged droughts during the last 50 years due to natural climate variations, but might see persistent droughts in the next 20–50 years. Future efforts to predict drought will depend on models' ability to predict tropical {SSTs}.

	abstract = {Abstract
            This paper examines the controls on global precipitation that are evident in the transient experiments conducted using coupled climate models collected for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ({IPCC}) Fourth Assessment Report ({AR}4). The change in precipitation, water vapor, clouds, and radiative heating of the atmosphere evident in the 1\% increase in carbon dioxide until doubled (1pctto2x) scenario is examined. As noted in other studies, the ensemble-mean changes in water vapor as carbon dioxide is doubled occur at a rate similar to that predicted by the Clausius–Clapeyron relationship. The ratio of global changes in precipitation to global changes in water vapor offers some insight on how readily increased water vapor is converted into precipitation in modeled climate change. This ratio ɛ is introduced in this paper as a gross indicator of the global precipitation efficiency under global warming.
            The main findings of this paper are threefold. First, increases in the global precipitation track increase atmospheric radiative energy loss and the ratio of precipitation sensitivity to water vapor sensitivity is primarily determined by changes to this atmospheric column energy loss. A reference limit to this ratio is introduced as the rate at which the emission of radiation from the clear-sky atmosphere increases as water vapor increases. It is shown that the derived efficiency based on the simple ratio of precipitation to water vapor sensitivities of models in fact closely matches the sensitivity derived from simple energy balance arguments involving changes to water vapor emission alone. Second, although the rate of increase of clear-sky emission is the dominant factor in the change to the energy balance of the atmosphere, there are two important and offsetting processes that contribute to ɛ in the model simulations studied: One involves a negative feedback through cloud radiative heating that acts to reduce the efficiency; the other is the global reduction in sensible heating that counteracts the effects of the cloud feedback and increases the efficiency. These counteracting feedbacks only apply on the global scale. Third, the negative cloud radiative heating feedback occurs through reductions of cloud amount in the middle troposphere, defined as the layer between 680 and 440 {hPa}, and by slight global cloud decreases in the lower troposphere. These changes act in a manner to expose the warmer atmosphere below to high clouds, thus resulting in a net warming of the atmospheric column by clouds and a negative feedback on the precipitation.},

              on plant growth depends on the availability of other resources like water, nitrogen and phosphate, which are usually very abundant in agro-systems but limited in natural ecosystems. However, even when resources are short some plants (the “winners”) may become
 more efficient competitors for these resources than others (the “losers”), causing global {CO}

              enrichment to become a biodiversity issue. While 1 per cent of the global biomass is growing under fertile agricultural conditions, more than 95 per cent of the global vegetation
 produces biomass without any artificial addition of resources. Hence, understanding {CO}

              effects on biodiversity requires experiments conducted in diverse, low-fertility systems, a model for which are calcareous grasslands. First results indicate increased carbon uptake by plants
 during the day but no change in biomass. In addition, tissue quality changes and species-specific responses were observed which were not predicted by any current theory. These results indicate that predictions of the future development of complex plant assemblages can not be made from
 data obtained in simplified fertile systems but need to consider the multitude of interactions between organisms as they occur in the field. With more than 70 plant species per 100 m

	abstract = {The rising levels of atmospheric {CO}2 are likely to increase biomass production of C3 species in both natural and managed ecosystems because photosynthetic rates will be higher.  The greatest absolute increase in productivity will occur when nitrogen and phosphorus availability in the soil is high. Low nitrogen does not preclude a growth response to high {CO}2, whereas some C3 species fail to respond to high {CO}2 when phosphorus is low, possibly because insufficient phosphorus is available to maintain maximum photosynthetic activity at high {CO}2. C3 plants response to high {CO}2 because the flux of carbon through the photoreductive cycle is increased and photorespiration is suppressed. This change in metabolism appears to alter the foliar nutrient concentration required to promote maximum productivity (critical concentration). Higher phosphorus concentrations are needed at elevated {CO}2, whereas the nitrogen requirement is reduced by {CO}2 enrichment. Since critical concentrations are used to evaluate nutrient status of crop and forest species and to manage fertiliser programs, they will need reassessing as the atmospheric {CO}2 concentration rises. Another consequence of the altered nutrient requirement at high {CO}2 is that the nitrogen concentrations of foliage, roots and grain are consistently lower in plants grown at elevated {CO}2, irrespective of availability of nitrogen in the soil. In natural ecosystems, the lower nitrogen to carbon ratio of the litter may alter rates of nutrient cycling. For farmers, the rising {CO}2 concentrations could cause reductions in grain nitrogen, and therefore protein content. This could have important implications for baking quality of hard wheats as well as affecting the nutrient value of grain such as rice.},
